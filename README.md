# hw-01-code-refactor

## DESCRIPTION

The first homework assignment for the Georgia Tech Bootcamp was to be able to integrate HTML, CSS, and Git. The main point of the assignment was to clean up the code and leave it nicer for the next developer. After editing the files, we were then supposed to use the steps of git to help upload it to the repository for public publication.

## WHAT

Activity included a pre-made HTML file along with a CSS file. Original HTML file was too bulky and long using a lot of <div>. Instructions were to use html semantics (header, footer, aside, section, etc) to clean it up and make it easier to read. By using the newly edited semantic html we were then supposed to clean up the CSS that goes along with the file. 

For example:

HTML file had three different classes (A,B,C)
(class=A, class=B, class=C)
That means CSS had three different classes
But they all had the same style

This is where semantics come into play..

Change A,B,C to one class (class=A)
Delete CSS .B and .C and just bunch to .A

Should work all the same, but now its cleaner and shorter


# WHY
This exercise was designed to help us understand how to edit, style, and publish the content.

# HOW
Uploading to the Github repository takes a couple of steps.

First you must make sure you have a repository set.

Then make sure you are saving all the work into that repository.

Follow the steps:

Git status (checks if you have edited anything)
Git add (if you did edit, then add .)
Git status (check to be sure)
Git commit (messages to show what you were thinkning)
Git status (check again becuase you never know)
Git pull (always pull to make sure your repository is set)
Git push (push it to the repository)
